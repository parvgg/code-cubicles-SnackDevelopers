            Affordable healthcare in rural India is a major concern, affecting millions. Many areas lack medical facilities, trained professionals, and essential medicines, making quality care inaccessible. High medical costs further limit access for low-income families, leading to reliance on unqualified practitioners and increased illness and preventable deaths. A comprehensive solution requires better government funding, improved infrastructure, and innovative delivery models tailored to rural needs.<br><br>
